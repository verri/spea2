# SPEA2

This is a header-only, generic C++ implementation of the SPEA2 algorithm<sup>[1](#paper)</sup>.

## Requirements

To use the library, you will need

- C++14-compliant compiler
- Boost >=1.63
  - [Boost.Range](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/range/doc/html/index.html)
  - [Boost.Geometry](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/index.html)

Older versions of Boost might work, but I haven't tested it.

## Example

This library and all its requirements are header-only.  Thus, the only thing you need is to include
the headers in your project.  The core of the library is the class `spea2::algorithm` which expects
a user-defined optimization problem as a template argument.  Such feature enables a generic, optimized
library with no virtual calls.

The user-defined problem must comply with the following class:
```c++
class problem
{
public:
  static constexpr std::size_t objective_count = /* ... */;
  using individual_type = /* ... */;
  using generator_type = /* ... */;

  auto evaluate(const individual_type& x, generator_type&) const 
    -> std::array<std::size_t, objective_count>;
  
  auto mutate(individual_type& x, generator_type& g) const 
    -> void;
  
  auto recombine(const individual_type& x, const individual_type& y, generator_type& g) const
    -> std::array<individual_type, objective_count>;
    
   /* ... */
};

```

To illustrate the usage, let's implement a multi-objective
[Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).

First, we include the required headers.
```c++
#include <spea2/algorithm> // spea2::make_algorithm, spea2::draw
#include <random>          // std::mt19937
#include <valarray>        // std::valarray
```

## Contributing

I've tried to implement it as close as possible to the original algorithm.
Any discrepancy may be reported at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/verri/spea2/issues).

The library should be flexible enough to work in most of the common cases, 
but if it doesn't fit into your problem, please let me know (or send me a pull request).

Pull requests are welcomed, especially for

- performance optimizations 
- C++11 compliance
  - that should be possible with only few tweaks
- dependency reduction
  - Boost.Range could be easily dropped
- improve genericity
