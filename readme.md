# SPEA2

This is a header-only, generic C++ implementation of the SPEA2 algorithm<sup>[1](#paper)</sup>.

## Requirements

To use the library, you will need

- C++14-compliant compiler
- Boost >=1.63
  - [Boost.Range](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/range/doc/html/index.html)
  - [Boost.Geometry](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/index.html)

Older versions of Boost might work, but I haven't tested it.

## Example

## Contributing

I've tried to implement it as close as possible to the original algorithm.
Any discrepancy may be reported at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/verri/spea2/issues).

The library should be flexible enough to work in most of the common cases, 
but if it doesn't fit into your problem, please let me know (or send me a pull request).

Pull requests are welcomed, especially for

- performance optimizations 
- C++11 compliance
  - that should be possible with only few tweaks
- dependency reduction
  - Boost.Range could be easily dropped
- improve genericity
