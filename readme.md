# SPEA2

This is a header-only, generic C++ implementation of the SPEA2 algorithm<sup>[1](#paper)</sup>.

## Requirements

To use the library, you will need

- C++14-compliant compiler
- Boost >=1.63
  - [Boost.Range](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/range/doc/html/index.html)
  - [Boost.Geometry](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/geometry/doc/html/index.html)

Older versions of Boost might work, but I haven't tested them.

## Documentation

This library and all its requirements are header-only.  Thus, the only thing you need is to include
the headers in your project.  The core of the library is the class `spea2::algorithm` which expects
a user-defined optimization problem as a template argument.  Such feature enables a generic, optimized
library with no virtual calls.

The user-defined problem must comply with the following class:
```c++
class problem
{
public:
  static constexpr std::size_t objective_count = /* ... */;
  using individual_type = /* ... */;
  using generator_type = /* ... */;

  auto evaluate(const individual_type&, generator_type&)
    -> std::array<double, objective_count>;
  
  auto recombine(const individual_type&, const individual_type&, generator_type&)
    -> std::array<individual_type, objective_count>;
  
  auto mutate(individual_type&, generator_type&) 
    -> void;
    
   /* ... */
};
```

The static member `problem::objective_count` is the number of objectives in the problem.
The aliases (or nested classes) `problem::individual_type` and `problem::generator_type` 
are the type of the individuals and a 
[random number engine](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random), respectively.

The function members `problem::evaluate`, `problem::recombine`, and `problem::mutate` 
define the functioning of the algorithm.  

`problem::evaluate` is called *exactly once* per individual during the execution of the algorithm.
It receives the individual to evaluate and a random engine, and it must return one `double`
per objective.  The algorithm will try to minimize such objectives.

`problem::recombine` is called for every two selected (by binary tournament) individuals
from the archive to populate the next generation.  It receives references to the individuals 
and a random engine, and it must return two new individual.  The new individuals (which can
be the same, if the user wants to) go the next population.

`problem::mutate` is called *exactly once* per individual outputed by `problem::recombine`.
It receives the individual and a random engine.  This is the only function that can (and should)
modify the input individual.

The class doesn't necessarily need to have exactly the same function-member signatures,
however the return time must match. Parameters type must be compatible.  If the user-defined
class doesn't comply with the requirement, a `static_assert` is triggered, avoiding nasty
compiler cries.

Once you define the problem class, you can use the algorithm:
```c++
int main() 
{
  // ===== Prepare input and instanciate the algorithm ===== //
  
  problem myproblem = /* ... */
  std::vector<problem::individual_type> initial_population = /* ... */;
  std::size_t archive_size = /* ... */
  std::default_random_engine generator;
  
  spea2::algorithm<myproblem> algorithm(std::move(myproblem), std::move(initial_population), archive_size, std::move(generator));
  // or
  // auto algorithm = spea2::make_algorithm(std::move(myproblem), std::move(initial_population), archive_size, std::move(generator));
  
  // ===== Iterate the algorithm ===== //
  
  const unsigned generation_count = 100u;
  for (unsigned i = 0u; i < 100; ++i)
    algorithm.iterate();
    
  // ===== Retrieve solution information ===== //
    
  // Every candidate solution in the archive.
  for (const spea2::algorithm<problem>::solution_type& solution : algorithm.archive())
  {
    const problem::individual_type& x = solution.x;
    const std::array<double, problem::objective_count>& fx = solution.fx;
    double fitness = solution.fitness; // As described in the paper.
  }
  
  // Only non-dominated solutions.
  for (const auto& solution : algorithm.nondominated())
  {
    const problem::individual_type& x = solution.x;
    const std::array<double, problem::objective_count>& fx = solution.fx;
    double fitness = solution.fitness; // As described in the paper.
  }
  
  // ===== Other helpers ===== //
  
  std::default_random_engine& generator = algorithm.engine();
  problem& problem = algorithm.problem();
}
```

## Example

To illustrate the usage, let's implement a multi-objective
[Knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).

First, we include the required headers.
```c++
#include <spea2/algorithm> // spea2::make_algorithm, spea2::draw
#include <random>          // std::mt19937
#include <valarray>        // std::valarray
```

Then, we define the problem class.
```c++
class knapsack
{
public:
  static constexpr auto objective_count = 2ul;
  using individual_type = std::valarray<bool>;
  using generator_type = std::mt19937;

  knapsack(std::array<std::valarray<double>, objective_count> values,
           std::valarray<double> weights, double capacity, double mutation_rate,
           double recombination_rate)
  { 
    /* ... */ 
  }

  auto evaluate(const individual_type& x, generator_type&) const
  {
    auto result = std::array<double, objective_count>{};
    const auto overweight = weights[x].sum() > capacity;

    for (auto i = 0ul; i < objective_count; ++i)
      result[i] = overweight ? 0.0 : -values[i][x].sum();

    return result;
  }

  auto mutate(individual_type& x, generator_type& g) const -> void
  {
    for (auto& allele : x)
      if (spea2::draw(mutation_rate, g))
        allele = !allele;
  }

  auto recombine(const individual_type& parent1, const individual_type& parent2,
                 generator_type& g) const -> std::array<individual_type, objective_count>
  {
    if (!spea2::draw(recombination_rate, g))
      return {{parent1, parent2}};

    auto mask = individual_type(parent1.size());
    for (auto& v : mask)
      v = spea2::draw(0.5, g);

    return {{
      (parent1 && mask) || (parent2 && !mask), // first child
      (parent1 && !mask) || (parent2 && mask)  // second child
    }};
  }

private:
  std::array<std::valarray<double>, objective_count> values;
  std::valarray<double> weights;
  double capacity;

  double mutation_rate, recombination_rate;
};
```

This problem describes a two-objectives knapsack problem.  We chose std::mt19937 the random number
engine.  The genotype representation is a sequence of boolean values where each value indicates
whether an items is in the bag or not.  Our problem instance stores:

- `knapsack::values`: The values of each item for each objective.
- `knapsack::weights`:  The weight of each item.
- `knapsack::capacity`: The bag maximum capacity.
- `knapsack::mutation_rate`: The chance of each allele being flipped.
- `knapsack::recombination_rate`: The chance of crossover.

Since we want to maximize the value of the bag, and `spea2::algorithm` minimizes the objective
function, `knapsack::evaluate` returns the arithmetic inverse of the total value.  If the bag
is storing more than can carry, the result is 0 for all objectives.

`knapsack::mutate` flips every allele with chance `knapsack::mutation_rate`.  The utility
function `spea2::draw(double rate, generator&)` returns `true` with chance `rate`.

`knapsack::recombine` applies uniform crossover with chance `knapsack::recombination_rate`.
Otherwise, it forwards the parents.

## Contributing

I've tried to implement it as close as possible to the original algorithm.
Any discrepancy may be reported at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/verri/spea2/issues).

The library should be flexible enough to work in most of the common cases, 
but if it doesn't fit into your problem, please let me know (or send me a pull request).

Pull requests are welcomed, especially for

- performance optimizations 
- C++11 compliance
  - that should be possible with only few tweaks
- dependency reduction
  - Boost.Range could be easily dropped
- improve genericity
